# betthread

Write a HTTP-based backend in Java which stores and provides the stakes for different customers and bet offers, with the capability to return the highest stakes on a bet offer. Also, the service needs to have a simple session management system as well, but with no authentication. 

Nonfunctional Requirements 
- There is no persistence and the application needs to be able to run indefinitely without crashing 
- The service needs to be able to handle a lot of simultaneous requests, so bear in mind the memory and CPU resources at your disposal 
- The data needs to stay consistent 
- Do not use any external frameworks, except maybe for testing. For HTTP the server itâ€™s up to you on how you wish to implement it. If you wish to use an already implemented one, you can use com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer. 

Functional Requirements 
- <value> means a call parameter value or a return value 
- All calls need to result in a 200 HTTP status code, unless something goes wrong, when anything but 200 must be returned 
- Number parameters and returned values are sent in decimal ASCII as expected 
- Customers and bet offers are created on the spot, the first time they are referenced
