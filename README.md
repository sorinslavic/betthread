# betthread

Write a HTTP-based backend in Java which stores and provides the stakes for different customers and bet offers, with the capability to return the highest stakes on a bet offer. Also, the service needs to have a simple session management system as well, but with no authentication. 

Nonfunctional Requirements 
- There is no persistence and the application needs to be able to run indefinitely without crashing 
- The service needs to be able to handle a lot of simultaneous requests, so bear in mind the memory and CPU resources at your disposal 
- The data needs to stay consistent 
- Do not use any external frameworks, except maybe for testing. For HTTP the server itâ€™s up to you on how you wish to implement it. If you wish to use an already implemented one, you can use com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer. 

Functional Requirements 
- <value> means a call parameter value or a return value 
- All calls need to result in a 200 HTTP status code, unless something goes wrong, when anything but 200 must be returned 
- Number parameters and returned values are sent in decimal ASCII as expected 
- Customers and bet offers are created on the spot, the first time they are referenced 

# solution

A specific requirement was to NOT use any external frameworks - no spring, no maven, no log4j, not even Mockito for testing.

I used the HttpServer from com.sun.net.httpserver to not bother parsing the HTTP message. I have an example solution for that in the https://github.com/sorinslavic/adoberserver repo.

Since Spring IoC is not used - I used examples of singletons (eager init) for components that are shared accross threads (Bet Repository and Session Cache).
Similarly I avoided using log4j or any other sl4j framework and added a very basic Log class that will print to the system.out various details from within the code.

# HTTP Server
The port is currently hard-coded to 8001 - FIXME - might change :)

The application will await for HTTP messages received on the 8001 port and will handle them using a thread pool configuration. After some google - it seems that the recomended size for a thread pool is the number of processors on the machine. I am not sure if I am following that recommandation since I have a thread for the socket connection entry point into the system and then a thread pool to handle the requests.

Since there are a predefined number of messages we will handle - I have an intermediate dispatcher that will identify if the requests are GET - get session or get highstakes - or POST (post bet offer) - and will delegate to the appropriate handler to perform the actual processing.

If the GET or POST requests are handled successfuly - we will return the HTTP 200 OK status - otherwise we might return 404 (if the requested url is unknown), 403 Forbidden (if the session key is not valid) or 500 internal error (when an exception is caught).

# Session management
For the Session management I implemented a SessionCache class that has a ConcurrentHashMap that registered the generated sessions. The actuall session key is generated using a Random.nextLong number that is then converted to HEX so to have both numbers and letters (A-F) :)
It's a silly method - but I think it is optimized since the session map uses the Long ID as the Key - instead of the String representation and that would speed up access to the values.

Given the nature of Random - there are changes that the same session id will be generated - for this we use a fall back - if the generated session is already stored in the cache - we generate a new one.
This might have a performance penalty associated.
Another possible issue is the fact that "expired" sessions are still stored on the server in the hash map - possibly reducing search time calls.

# Bet Offer repository
The use case is the following: Using a generated session - each customer will place stakes for a particular bet offer. These stakes are processed at the same time - each customer might place multiple stakes. At any point - we might want to retrieve the top 20 stakes that are placed for a particular bet offer.

Since there is no persistency required for the data - the placed stakes are stored in memory - inside a class BetRepository.
Similarly to the SessionCache - the data is stored inside a ConcurrentHashMap linking Bet Offer IDS to a set containing all of the Customer Stakes that were placed. The set is kept sorted in descending order - to use it automatically on data retrieval.

Both the operations on the map and on the set are atomic and synchronized. 

# Testing
The only JARs that are include in the build path for the project are junit and hamcrest. 
I avoided using a mocking framework (EasyMock / Mockito) - and built my own "mocks" that have the option to return predefined data and to log what parameters certain methods were called for it.

For the statefull singletons - BetRepository, SessionCache - i was forced to add a "clear" method inside them that i used to "clear" the data from the map. FIXME - might change

# JS Client
Add an index.html page and some jQuery JS that will execute parallel GET/POST requests on the server.
